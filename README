This is a Wordpress plugin to add tags for http://recettes.de, a French directory of culinary blogs.

To install: 
Download the archive of the current MASTER, located at https://github.com/Balise42/RecettesDe-Tags/zipball/master
Put the content in your wp-plugins directory. The tree looks as follows: wp-plugins > RecettesDe-Tags > recettesde-tags.php
Add in the single.php file of your theme a reference to the "the_recettes_tags" functionÂ ; for instance, put after the regular Wordpress tags the following code:

<?php if (function_exists("the_recettes_tags")) {
  the_recettes_tags('<p>Tags <a href="http://recettes.de/cuisine">Recettes de Cuisine</a> : ', '</p>'); 
}
?>

The first argument is the text/HTML code leading the tags, the second one is the text/HTML to put after the tags.

Activate the plugin, you should be all set!
A new field appears in the post editing interface where you can add tags as you want them to be displayed, separated by commas.
